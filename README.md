ü©∫ Skin Cancer Detection

This project focuses on building a deep learning‚Äìbased system for skin cancer detection, with a special emphasis on melanoma, one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer. The model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically analyze dermoscopic images and distinguish between malignant and benign lesions.

By training on a large and diverse dataset containing multiple types of skin cancer, the system learns to recognize subtle visual patterns that are often difficult to detect with the naked eye. The ultimate goal is to provide dermatologists with a reliable decision-support tool that can:

‚ö° Accelerate diagnosis by automatically evaluating images.

üéØ Improve accuracy in early melanoma detection, which is crucial for patient survival.

üõ†Ô∏è Reduce manual workload, allowing medical professionals to focus on treatment and patient care.

This solution highlights the potential of AI in healthcare, demonstrating how deep learning can assist in life-saving early detection while minimizing the need for exhaustive manual screening.
